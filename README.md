# Phort
### The Python + GNU/Linux Tor router CLI

_**Archived!**_

#### What is it?
Phort is the Tor router CLI for Python + GNU/Linux. Phort is a one stop shop for configuring your device to routing all of its traffic through the Tor network. With a simple, intuitive command-line interface, Phort will help keep you anonymous and more secure on the Internet.

###### DISCLAIMER
Phort is a Python adaptation of [Nipe](https://github.com/GouveaHeitor/nipe), and was a fun project to tinker with (I learned some things about networking). That being said, Nipe is a wonderful piece of software written by [Heitor GouvÃªa](https://github.com/GouveaHeitor) and is better-suited for accomplishing the task of routing system network via Tor. Show some love and go give Nipe a try.
